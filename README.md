<h2>Scode: AI Platform</h2>


Welcome to Scode, an AI platform that I’ve developed with passion and curiosity by myself! 
<br/>
<br/>
What Is Scode?<br/>

Scode is an intelligent platform that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to assist users in various ways. Whether you’re a developer, a student, or just someone curious about technology, Scode has something to offer.

#Features<br/>
<br/>
1- Code Generation and Suggestions:<br/>
Scode can generate code snippets based on natural language descriptions. Need a quick Python function? Just ask!
It also provides context-aware suggestions while you’re coding. Say goodbye to endless Google searches for syntax!

2- API Integration with Gemini:<br/>
Scode is powered by the Gemini API. Gemini is a versatile platform that allows you to access data, perform calculations, and even interact with external services—all through simple API calls.
With Gemini, Scode can pull in real-time data, analyze trends, and provide insights.
